Mini ML project for parmee prize

- I'm starting this project as an extension of some work I did for the Parmee Prize run by Pembroke College, Cambridge
- This was an entrepreneurship prize which I entered with two fellow Pembroke students
- The idea I came to them with was a way of ranking products on e-commerce sites based on some "sustainbility" criteria
