# parmee_prize
Mini ML project for parmee prize

- I'm starting this project as an extension of some work I did for the Parmee Prize run by Pembroke College, Cambridge
- This was an entrepreneurship prize which I entered with two fellow Pembroke students
- The idea I came to them with was a way of ranking products on e-commerce sites based on some "sustainbility" criteria
- We got through to the final round of the competition with our proposal, so I began to work on a demo we would show during the presentation
- The demo took data from AutoTrader (7 features), normalised them, applied a normalized weight vector, and outputted a score which was used to rank the cars
